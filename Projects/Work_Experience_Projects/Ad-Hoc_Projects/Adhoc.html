    <h2><b>Some Ad-Hoc Projects</b></h2>
    <p>Apart from the major, high-impact projects, I was also assigned several ad-hoc projects that required immediate attention. These projects turned out to be huge learning opportunities for me and often sparked ideas that later shaped the bigger initiatives.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Geo-fencing of stores and Removal of Ghost Outlets</b></li>
        <p>In this project, geo tagging of stores was made mandatory to ensure that salespeople were actually visiting the outlets and taking orders. To enforce this, we implemented a <b>100 meter geo fencing rule</b>, so that an order could only be placed if the salesperson was physically within the defined area of the store.</p>

        <p>While implementing this, we discovered that a number of stores were incorrectly tagged. Some appeared under a bridge, others under a tree, which explained why certain orders were not being captured correctly.</p>

        <p>To identify these ghost outlets, we applied a <b>sampling based approach</b>. We selected a subset of stores where no orders had been placed for an extended period and used <b>stratified random sampling</b> to ensure coverage across different cities, regions, and store types. We then analyzed their geo coordinates using the <b>Haversine distance</b> to calculate the actual distance between the recorded store location and the nearest valid road or area. This helped us pinpoint stores that were wrongly tagged or inactive.</p>

        <p>Once the problematic locations were identified, the team physically verified a few sample stores to confirm the errors. This process not only corrected the geo tagging but also cleaned up the system and improved <b>master data management</b>, ensuring that the data now reflected real, actionable stores.</p>

        <li><b>HoReCa Connect – High potential outlet intelligence</b></li>
        <p>This project was built by a small team of three people, and I had the opportunity to lead the work. We started by creating a structured database of Hotels, Restaurants and Caterers and built a complete master list of outlets. From this list, we identified and tagged the ones that had high potential to become buyers of our company’s products based on outlet type, size, location, and historical buying behavior.</p>

        <p>One of the most interesting parts of the project was working with restaurant and catering menus. We collected menu level data and analyzed the monthly consumption patterns. We broke down dishes into recipe level ingredients and mapped them to our product portfolio. Based on this mapping, we built a simple demand estimation logic that projected the quantity of our products that each outlet could consume every month. These projections were then displayed directly inside the salesperson’s app, so they could easily pitch the right products with the right quantities during store visits.</p>

        <p>From a technical perspective, we applied multiple filtering techniques to make the recommendations more intelligent. We used rule based filtering to shortlist relevant products based on outlet type and cuisine. We also used <b>collaborative filtering</b> principles where buying behavior of similar outlets was used to recommend products. For cross selling, we implemented <b>market basket analysis</b> using frequent itemset mining and association rules, which helped identify product combinations that were commonly bought together.</p>

        <p>On the technology side, we built the mobile application using <b>Flutter</b> to ensure it worked smoothly across devices. For the backend, we used <b>Google Cloud Firebase</b> as the database, which helped us store outlet data, product mappings, and recommendation logic in real time. The Flutter app was connected to Firebase through APIs, enabling real time data sync and fast access to recommendations for the sales team.</p>

        <p>Overall, the app turned a very manual and guess based sales process into a structured, data driven, and guided selling experience for the field team.</p>
