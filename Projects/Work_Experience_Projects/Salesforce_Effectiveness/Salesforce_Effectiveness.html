    <!-- Quick Summary -->
    <div class="quick-summary">
    <p>
    This project focused on optimising sales routes to improve daily productivity and consistency among salespeople. 
    Using geo coordinates, clustering techniques like K Medoids and Gaussian Mixture Models, and TSP-based routing algorithms, we designed efficient, practical daily routes. 
    The output included cluster-wise route sequences and interactive dashboards for managers and sales teams. 
    Business outcomes showed reduced travel time, improved store coverage, and better adherence to schedules. 
    Personally, I gained experience in translating complex algorithms into actionable business solutions and managing change effectively.

    <div class="content-collapsible">
        <p>Sales numbers in the company were strong, which initially made it seem like most of the sales team was performing really well. But when we actually dug into the KPIs, we noticed something interesting. A handful of salespeople were outperforming their targets by a huge margin, while a few others were consistently falling short. When we reached out to the ones who were struggling, we kept hearing the same reasons again and again. Their routes were not structured well. In bigger cities they were losing time in traffic, and in smaller cities they were facing reachability issues. In some cases the store timings did not match the time they were reaching the store, so they were either waiting too long or missing the window entirely. Considering all these challenges, it became clear that their routes needed to be optimised. The idea was to group stores in a way that made practical sense, and the best way to do that was by using their geo coordinates to create more efficient and achievable routes for the sales team.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Learnings from the Project</button>
    <div class="content-collapsible">
        <p>This project was much larger than it looked on paper, and there was a lot of change management involved. Once the new routes were designed and shared, getting the sales team to actually follow them took time and patience. We had to convince them that the new approach would genuinely make their day easier and more productive. The algorithm behind the routing was quite mathematical, but when we explained it to the team, we had to break everything down in simple, plain English so it made sense in their everyday context. Learning how to translate something technical into something relatable was one of the most important skills I gained from this project.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Business Impact</button>
<div class="content-collapsible">
    <p>It made the entire sales process a lot smoother. Salespeople were able to cover more stores in the same amount of time because their routes finally made sense. Missed visits dropped, store relationships improved, and managers got a much clearer view of who needed support. Overall, it helped the business drive better productivity without putting extra pressure on the team. In this business impact, it also cut average daily travel by <b>1.8 miles</b> per salesman and reduced carbon emissions by <b>2.5kg</b>, boosting both productivity and sustainability</p>
