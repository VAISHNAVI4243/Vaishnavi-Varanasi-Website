   <!-- Quick Summary -->
<div class="quick-summary">
    <p>
    This project aimed to track real-time check-in and check-out times of the sales team to ensure timely store visits during critical business hours. We designed a data pipeline using APIs to capture events, standardized timestamps, applied geo-fencing checks, and calculated key measures like Delay Minutes and On Time Flag. A Python-based event-driven chatbot with voice alerts was connected to the updated Power BI dashboard to notify salespeople of late check-ins. The outcome was a centralized view of adherence and delays, enabling managers to take timely action and improving overall efficiency and accountability. Technically, the project strengthened my skills in live data processing, event-based triggers, and building reliable automated alert systems.

    <div class="content-collapsible">
        <p>For the company, the main goal had always been to continuously increase sales. After implementing the Salesforce Effectiveness project, route planning and coverage improved a lot. But when we went deeper into the data, we noticed another important pattern. Early morning sales, especially when stores first opened, were extremely critical. That first interaction of the day often decided how much stock the store would pick up. The problem was that many salespeople were not reaching the stores on time during these key hours.</p>

        <p>After several brainstorming sessions between the sales team and the COE team, it became clear that there was no real visibility of when salespeople were actually reaching and leaving the stores. Everything was happening, but nothing was being tracked in a structured, centralised way. That is when the idea of creating a centralised tracking system came up. The plan was to build a Power BI dashboard that would capture and display the check in and check out times of salespeople in real time. To make the process proactive, the dashboard outputs were connected to a chatbot system. Whenever a check in happened later than the expected time, the chatbot would automatically trigger a voice call to alert and notify the salesperson.</p>

        <p>This project was focused on bringing visibility, accountability, and real time action into the sales process, especially during the most critical hours of the day.</p>

        <p>Technically, this project was quite challenging as it involved near real time data processing and system integrations. I learned how to handle live data streams, work with event based triggers, and build reliable alerting mechanisms that work without manual intervention.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Approach</button>
    <div class="content-collapsible">
        <ol>
            <li><b>Power BI and Data Engineering Logic</b>: Designed the data pipeline to capture check in and check out events via APIs. Created fact and dimension tables, implemented timestamp standardization, geo fencing checks, duplicate handling, and calculated measures like Delay Minutes and On Time Flag.</li>
            <li><b>Chatbot Development and Technical Architecture</b>: Built a Python-based event-driven chatbot to notify salespeople of late check-ins. Integrated Twilio for voice alerts, applied delay logic, captured responses, and linked events back to Power BI for reporting. Implemented retries, cooldowns, and logging to ensure reliability.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Output</button>
    <div class="content-collapsible">
        <p>We built a centralised Power BI dashboard that showed real time check-in and check-out times for every salesperson. The system flagged late check-ins and triggered automated voice alerts through the chatbot, making it proactive rather than reactive. Managers could now track daily adherence, see patterns in delays, and take timely action, while salespeople received immediate reminders to stay on schedule.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Business Impact</button>
<div class="content-collapsible">
    <p>
        The system gave the business clear visibility into when salespeople were actually reaching the stores, especially during critical early morning hours. It helped reduce missed or delayed visits, ensuring that key sales opportunities were not lost. Managers could now monitor adherence easily and provide support where needed, while salespeople received real-time nudges to stay on schedule, improving overall efficiency and productivity. Built a real-time <b>Power BI tracker</b> integrated via API with sales systems and enhanced with an <b>AI voice-enabled chatbot</b> for daily updates, cutting manual reporting by <b>80%</b> and reducing issue response time by <b>40%</b>.
